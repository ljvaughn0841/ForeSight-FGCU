# ForeSight-FGCU

Foresight’s object is safety. People constantly look down at their phone and are unaware of their surroundings. Foresight’s mission is to tap into a person’s camera, see obstacles around them, use AI to detect if there is a potential problem and if there is, notify the person via notification. We are currently developing this program in python to work with a webcam plugged into a computer with plans to expand this to work on a mobile device.
